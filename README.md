## Calibrated Techniques: Ways to Improve Fraud Detection Systems.

A data science project made by Tean Patrick, Data Science Fellows Cohort 7 in Eskwelabs.
The aim of this sprint project is to apply big data analytics in order to recreate a credit card fraud detection system

**Case Study Scenario:** 

Your model went into production with the setting of automatically rejecting fraudulent transactions, but unfortunately it blocked the CEO’s credit card when she went travelling for a snap business meeting and couldn’t check into her hotel! She is furious and has asked for an immediate report on what happened. Fortunately her chief of staff has a much cooler head, and sees this as an opportunity. 

The chief of staff realises that if it could happen to the CEO it may also be an experience our other customers might experience, and if we can bring together a number of different Agile Tribe leads together we could design a better solution. 

**Sprint Project Overview**

These false declines are becoming a costlier problem than actual fraud. Looking at US data, e-commerce merchants will lose $8.6 billion in falsely declined transactions in 2016. This amounts to over $2 billion more than the $6.5 billion in fraud they will prevent, meaning that false declines are undermining these merchants' ability to effectively combat fraud.

The effects of false bank declines are as follows:

1. Immediate revenue loss. Every order wrongly turned down is revenue not realized. 
2. Lost customer lifetime value. Lifetime customer value is the total profit anticipated from all future purchases by a customer. Legitimate customers who are wrongly rejected will often stop buying from that merchant permanently. 
3. Wasted acquisition spend. Acquisition spend refers to all the costs associated with convincing a consumer to place an order (e.g., research, marketing, and advertising). If you spend $10 to convince a customer to buy but mistakenly decline their order (i.e., false positive), you’ve wasted that $10 acquisition cost on top of the lost revenue. 
4. Degraded brand image. In today’s connected world of social media and viral posts, one shopper’s experience with a false positive can suddenly reach thousands and thousands of customers and potential customers. While difficult to quantify, the impact of negative publicity is nonetheless real. 

**Sprint Project Objectives**
1. Review current fraud detection system of fictional bank Eskwebanks using the given client profile and spending behavior data
2. Recommend ways to make the fraud detection system better
